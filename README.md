How to Deploy React Application to Firebase:

https://www.knowledgehut.com/blog/web-development/deploying-react-app-to-firebase

Go to firebase.google.com and start session with your Google account.

Click on Start and adda new project, introduce the name of your project.

Click on Continue, select the option "Not now" and press "Create project" button.

In your console:

firebase init hosting

In the Project setup, choose the option Use an existing project. 

And then select the Firebase project name that we have created. Our project name is my-app, so we’ll choose that. 

Finally, you’ll need to select the location where firebase will look for assets to deploy in the Hosting setup section. 
Production assets are saved in the build folder by default. Therefore, type build according to this option. 
Enter y for Configure as a single-page app option. Last but not least, you must decide whether or not to overwrite your existing build/index.html file. 
Therefore, select N (No) for this option because you need the actual index.html file generated by Reacts when you build your project. 

cd my-app

firebase login --interactive

npm run build
